//Method Class
//Note there are no functions in java, but they will be refreshing to for ease, Static methods in java acts as functions in python.

Crash course!! (Read up)

Examples

Public static int getAge(){
	return 40;
}

Public static int add (int a, int b){
	return a+b;
}

Public static void printName(String name){
	System.out.print(name);
}

If no void you must put return as seen above
Int, void is the output
What is in the bracket is the input, this is also t he number of parameters 


Public static int add (int a, int b){ and Public static int add (int b, int a){ are equivalent but not Public static int add (int a, double b){ and Public static int add (double a, int b){


This is because they are of different data types 

A method include the following 
Method name, Number of parameters, Order of parameter and the type of parameters

The order maters when the types are different , it doesn't matter when the types are the same

Overloading, Method overloading is when the same method has different ways to receive input, so when there's a single error it displays multiple errors

public class MethodsInJava{
	
	public static int add(int numberOne, int numberTwo){
		return numberOne + numberTwo;

	}
	public static int add(double numberOne, int numberTwo){
		return (int) numberOne + numberTwo;

	}
	public static int add(int numberOne, double numberTwo){
		return numberOne + (int)numberTwo;

	}
	public static int add(double numberOne, double numberTwo){
		return int(numberOne + numberTwo);
	}
}


public class MethodClass{
	
	public static void main(String [] args){
	
		int sum = MethodsInJava.add(5.8,6.4);
		System.out.print(sum);
	}
}
